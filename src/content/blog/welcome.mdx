Hello! I'm excited to finally have a space to share my thoughts on AI research and the journey of building intelligent systems.

## What I'll Write About

This blog will cover topics I'm passionate about:

### AI Agents & Computer Use

Building agents that can reliably interact with the real world is one of the most exciting frontiers in AI. I've been working on this problem at Amazon AGI SF Lab, and there's so much to explore around how we can make these systems more robust, generalizable, and aligned with human intentions.

### Reinforcement Learning

RL is at the heart of my research. From my PhD work of using RL in game environments to training production models like [Nova Act](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/build-reliable-ai-agents-for-ui-workflow-automation-with-amazon-nova-act-now-generally-available/), I've seen how powerful (and challenging!) RL can be. I'll share insights on what works, what doesn't, and where the field is heading.

### Human-AI Interaction

I believe some of the real secret sauce still lives in the human brain - how we plan, learn from sparse feedback, form explanations, and adapt under uncertainty. I hope to write about the cognitive science perspective on intelligence.


## Why Write?

A few reasons:

1. **Thinking in public** — Writing forces clarity. It helps me separate what I know from what I *assume* 

2. **Building in public** — I want to share the messy reality of research, not just the polished papers and products.
3. **Making space to think** — During the industrial revolution, physical labor was replaced, and people started going to the gym to deliberately train their bodies. Now we’re watching a similar shift for mental labor. This blog is my version of “going to the gym”: making time to slow down, think deeply, reflect, and write so I don’t outsource all my thinking to the machine.

4. **Connecting** — Some of the best collaborations come from putting ideas out there.

## Stay Tuned

I'll try to post regularly — probably a mix of technical deep-dives, research reflections, and occasional musings on the AI field.

Feel free to reach out if any of these topics resonate with you. I'm always happy to chat about AI agents, RL, or the future of intelligent systems.
